The code base is currently maintained by Kanja Saha(kanjasaha@gmail.com). 
Goal of this template is to make it available as open source project with contribution from the machine learning community.

This is a template for fullcycle machine learning projects, specifically for churn prediction.
It can be modified to any other classfication project as well.

cache: Preprocessed datasets that donâ€™t need to be re-generated every time you perform an analysis.
configuration: Configuration settings for the project
credentials: if webapi is used to access data
data: Raw data files.
modules: Helper library functions but not the core statistical analysis.
machine_learning_classes:

/*
munge: Preprocessing data munging code, the outputs of which are put in cache.
src: Statistical analysis scripts.
diagnostics: Scripts to diagnose data sets for corruption or outliers.
doc: Documentation written about the analysis.
graphs: Graphs created from analysis.

logs: Output of scripts and any automatic logging.
profiling: Scripts to benchmark the timing of your code.
reports: Output reports and content that might go into reports such as tables.
tests: Unit tests and regression suite for your code.
README: Notes that orient any newcomers to the project.
TODO: list of future improvements and bug fixes you plan to make.
